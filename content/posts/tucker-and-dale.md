I decided to take the evening off yesterday and went looking for something to watch on Netflix. After not finding anything new worth watching I decided to re-watch [Tucker and Dale vs Evil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1465522/). What a great movie!

It is still one of my favorites for the simple fact it is so unique. A hillbilly slasher flick told from the perspective of the hillbillies. Where the teenagers are the crazy ones terrorizing them. And the acting of the three main characters is so good (the others, meh). The chemistry between [Tyler Labine](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479527/), [Alan Tudyk](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876138/), and [Katrina Bowden](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2197298/) just pulls you into their story.

I had heard they were working on a [sequel back in 2014](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1685999/the-blunt-reason-tucker-and-dale-vs-evil-2-hasnt-happened-according-to-alan-tudyk-and-tyler-labine) but there hasn't been much news about it lately, which is never a good sign.

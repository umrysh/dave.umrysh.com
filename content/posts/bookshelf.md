I decided with how much I rely on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to keep track of my books I should probably have a backup somewhere. So for anyone interested in what yours truly plans to read, as well as my ratings of books I have already read, you can find my digital bookshelves here:

* [Read](https://git.umycode.com/dave/books/src/branch/master/read.md)
* [To Read](https://git.umycode.com/dave/books/src/branch/master/to-read.md)
* [Meh](https://git.umycode.com/dave/books/src/branch/master/meh.md)

I will update these lists periodically with any new books I have read or plan to read.

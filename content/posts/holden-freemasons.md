I'm not quite sure how I missed the fact that the Holden Freemason Lodge meets in the [upstairs of the Museum building](/img/holden.jpg). I've walked by this building so many times in my life and never noticed the square and compasses (which apparently says a lot about my ability to pay attention to my surroundings).

They also appear to be a fairly active lodge with a Fellow Craft degree being performed this month and a centennial celebration next month.

Methinks I may have to grab my apron and go for a visit. It would be pretty cool to attend lodge in the village where I grew up

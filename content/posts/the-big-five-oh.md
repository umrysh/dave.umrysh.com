Last month one of my close friends turned 50. I didn't even realize he was turning 50. I knew it was his birthday but it was like my brain chose to forget that little detail. I must admit, it kind of set me back a bit when I realized it.

We have known each other for a very long time but our friendship really started to form around the year 2005 when we had begun working together. At that time I was just starting to date my wife Erin and I would like to say I was what you would call a mature 21 year old. 

He was always the older friend but he never treated me like I was a kid. The age difference was never even a second thought to me. We shared the same interests and that was that. Fast forward 13 years and he turns 50 and I will be turning 34. 

13 years!

In that time I married Erin, we have two wonderful young boys. My friend married off two of his kids (a third is getting married in a month) and he just recently became a grandfather. So much has happened but it stills feels like only a few months ago we were hanging out in his backyard pool and talking about summer plans.

Where does the time go?

So here's to the next 13 Buddy! Thanks for always being there for me and my family and for always being a great friend #Cheers

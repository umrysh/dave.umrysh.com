Today the latest album from [Mipso](https://www.mipsomusic.com) was released. I have been listening to them on and off since the summer and was very much looking forward to some new songs to add to the playlist. The album as a whole is very much more of the same, but that is not a bad thing when you enjoy the previous albums. So far my favorite lyrics are from "Didn't Know Love":


"What does an old guitar say?
What does a deck of cards say?
How does an empty bar stool pass the time?"

I'm on my third listen of the album today and methinks that won't it won't be the last.
